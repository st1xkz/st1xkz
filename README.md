###### *Helloo :D* Iâ€™m sticks! I go by sticks/st1xkz but I bet you already knew that ;)
###### *I started coding around the same time I got back into Discord which was back in maybe November of 2020. Everything was shutting down from Covid so I wanted to pick up a new hobby and I found that you could make discord bots so I had asked some people about how to go with starting to code a discord bot and they recommended that I watched a video for beginners about ***__Python__***. ~~A week long video turned into taking a month or so to finish~~, and slowly but surely, my coding journey began and Iâ€™ve learned a lot since then*.
